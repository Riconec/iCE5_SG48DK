  - up to 3520LUT (4bit)
  - OTP NV Configuration Memory
  - up to 80kbit of a block RAM
  - 1 PPL 
  - 2 Hard I2C cores
  - 2 Hard SPI cores
  - internal 10kHz and 48MHz RCO
  - 3 channel current output pins up to 24mA 
  - 1 channel 500mA current output pin
  - up to 4 16x16 Multiply and 32 Accumulator block
