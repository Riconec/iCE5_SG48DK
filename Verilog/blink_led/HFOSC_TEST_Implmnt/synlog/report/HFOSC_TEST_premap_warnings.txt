@W: MT529 :"d:\drive\projects\lattice fpga\projects\hfosc_test\top.v":11:1:11:6|Found inferred clock top|o_clk_out_inferred_clock which controls 22 sequential elements including counter[20:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
